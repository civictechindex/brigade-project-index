description = "This was originally a mapping tool built in 2014 by the Philadelphia Food Policy Advisory Council (FPAC) in partnership with the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger and has since re-launched. The FPAC folks recently denied civic assitance to move forward on this project so it will remain in its current state (or indefinitely--thanks to buracreats at the FPAC with no sense of urgency)."
