description = "Chorebox is to be an alternative to -autoconf- -- only unlike -autoconf-, it will run at install-time rather than be a tool that only the developer needs. Some might shrink from this strategy in that it creates one more dependency -- but really, it doesn't do so any more than requiring this or that library would --- and using this strategy (rather than that embraced by -autoconf-) will afford far more flexibility in package design."
