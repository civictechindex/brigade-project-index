description = 'Electronic Intern will help the [PhillyASAP](http://phillyasap.org/) program maintain their listing of after-school programs in Philadelphia. Instead of having interns spend all summer cold-calling these programs, Electronic Intern will send automated calls that will direct the location to either send in their details by fax, a submit form on the website or press "4" to be directed back to PhillyASAP.'
