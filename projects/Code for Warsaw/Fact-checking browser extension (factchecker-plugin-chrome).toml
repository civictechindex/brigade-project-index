<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Demagog.org.pl initiative has been checking statements made by Polish politicians for over 2 years now. Demagog’s goal is to keep an eye on the politicians’ public activity and check whether they are telling the truth, using a fact-check methodology. We analyse how politicians form their arguments, we check the underlying facts, and we label them with: “truth”, “lie”, “manipulation” or “impossible to verify”.</span>\r
\r
We want people to consciously process information. We are creating browser extensions that will inject information about fact-checked statements straight to the articles that you are reading and even in your FB feed or Google results page.\r
\r
Features:\r
<ul>\r
 \t<li>highlight statements in text articles [tests]</li>\r
 \t<li>provide fact-checks in video and radio podcasts [in development]</li>\r
 \t<li>highlighted fact-checked articles in news aggregators: FB, Twitter, Google, big news outlets [in development]</li>\r
 \t<li>highlight statements without browser extensions using proxy, for example http://demagog.org.pl/czytaj/https://tvn24.pl/artykul1 [planned]</li>\r
 \t<li>highlight statements without browser extensions on partner media websites [planned]</li>\r
</ul>\r
Join us as a developer, designer, tester, editor, or an informed reader."""
