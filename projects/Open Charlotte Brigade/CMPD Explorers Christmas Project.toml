description = "Each year since 1974 CMPD provides Christmas presents for underprivileged children throughout Charlotte. This has been done by a tedious paper-based organizational process that included school counselors nominating families and CMPD working with partners to hold toy drives, allocate toys, and make deliveries. In 2016 Code for Charlotte built a digital platform that helped organize and speed up the process, allowing CMPD to deliver Christmas to over 1,700 children."
