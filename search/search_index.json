Adding your brigade\u2019s projects to the Statusboard can be done through one of several automated (or semi-automated) processes. Verify that your brigade is listed accurately \u00b6 The index automatically pulls data from the brigade-information project : View the organizations.json file and look for your brigade (a simple cmd-F should do the trick). If your brigade is already listed, check the following fields: \u201cprojects_list_url\u201d should be your brigade\u2019s GitHub URL. \u201ctags\u201d should include \u201cBrigade\u201d and \u201cCode for America\u201d. If your brigade is not listed there or you want to consider other ways to include your brigade\u2019s projects, choose one of the methods below. Ways to index your brigade\u2019s projects \u00b6 Method 1: Using your brigade\u2019s GitHub URL \u00b6 Do your brigade\u2019s projects live under your GitHub organization? You can just use the URL for that (i.e. https://github.com/codefornola ) as the key for \u201cprojects_list_url\u201d in the organizations.json file . If you have projects that live outside of GitHub, you\u2019ll have to create a \u201cplaceholder\u201d repo for each of those projects. These repos need only include a readme.md doc with relevant links to external project documentation as appropriate. Method 2) Using GitHub topics \u00b6 In this option, all brigade project repos should include a shared topic based on the brigade\u2019s name (eg openoakland or hack-for-la ). See GitHub\u2019s instructions for adding a topic to a repo . Method 3) Using Google Sheets \u00b6 Create a sheet with the same headers as this example (or just copy the example with File > Make a copy). Then select File > Publish to the web. Use the sheets popup to select just your sheet (not the whole document) and a CSV format. Use the link to this CSV as the value for the \u201c projects_list_url \u201d key in the organizations.json file . The link, once you have obtained it, should end in \u201c/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv\u201d. Tags should be comma separated in a single column. Method 4) Using a CSV or json file \u00b6 Google Sheets is a common tool so we\u2019ve written out instructions, but any JSON or CSV file with the right column headers and the correct link in the organizations.json file (see the Google Sheet instructions above) will do the trick. If you have questions or are interested in helping to improve the Brigade Project Index, please read the README on the repo and visit #brigade-project-index in the CfA slack. Tagging your brigade\u2019s projects \u00b6 The group that has been working on this project has begun to form a taxonomy . When assigning topics, please check the existing topics (and consider adding to the official set if something is missing) first to be sure you\u2019re not creating a duplicate. For COVID-19 related projects, please use the topic \u201ccovid-19\u201d. More about the Index and the Statusboard \u00b6 The index is the dataset we suck everything into. The statusboard is a tool for browsing the index that\u2019s been designed around helping brigade\u2019s assess their index status (hence it doing things like showing checkmarks for key details being filled in). The idea with the statusboard was for it to evolve into a one-stop-shop for brigade leaders and members to see how well their projects are indexed and where the gaps are. The reason for this layered approach was that we wanted to focus on collecting really quality data that could be distributed across the network for a variety of tools and uses. This way, there\u2019s a much stronger value prop for brigades to publish their projects into the index\u2013it doesn\u2019t just feed one tool/site we\u2019re building, but a whole ecosystem of brigade network tools that anyone can add to.
