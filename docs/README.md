# Brigade Project Index

## How to Get Involved

- Tag your projects on github!
  - Make sure your brigade's projects are listed in the index ([instructions](./contributing/list-brigade-projects.md))
  - Using the github "Topics", tag your project directly in github with #code-for-america and your brigade tag (e.g. code-for-sf). Then include any relevant topic tags from [this list](https://github.com/codeforamerica/civic-tech-taxonomy/tree/master/issues-addressed).

- [Search for Projects](https://brigade-project-index-test.herokuapp.com/#/topics)

- Join the discussion!
  - We primarily use slack (https://cfa.slack.com #brigade-project-index), and meet every 2 weeks, usually Sunday at 6pm. Drop a note in the slack channel to be included.
