# Overview

The aim at categorizing civic tech projects is tackled from different angles, with different approaches and multiple tools.

In this section you can see more about the various initiatives that different groups are working on.

Each project page provides a product roadmap, what help the project is looking for as well as how to get in touch with the project team.

In general, the large group meets on [Zoom](https://codeforamerica.zoom.us/j/96551956929?pwd=ME81S0ZUT1UwY3JTeFpaVXVZV25pdz09) every two weeks on Wednesday at 3 PM PT/ 5 PM CT / 6 PM ET
