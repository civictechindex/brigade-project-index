My goal is to turn this into a social networking website for small business owners in the Philadelphia area. I would like for this to be an online resource similar to this: www.biznik.com. I am a writer but not the type that writes code. I am the journalism/creative writer type and am looking for a techie that knows back-end development with a specialized knowledge of PHP and hand-coding from scratch. If anyone gets involved with my project not only will I give you a stake in my company and a life-time of free advertising on the front-page, but I will generously write a nice story about your small business on my blog. You can contact me via the following:","link_url":"www.SmallBizPhilly.com","name":"Small_Biz_Philly","organization_name":"Code for Philly","status":"Commenting"},"relationships":{"organization":{"data":{"type":"organization","id":"Code for Philly"},"links":{"related":"/organizations/Code for Philly.json"}}}}}
