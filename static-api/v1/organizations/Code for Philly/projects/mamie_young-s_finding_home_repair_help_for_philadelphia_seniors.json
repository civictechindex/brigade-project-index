This project supports Mamie Young's vision: creating a list of handymen and handywomen who sign on to do home repairs for seniors, at low cost and pro-bono. This is an important civic need. A few organizations cover some blocks and neighborhoods in the city, but in general, it's hard to find someone to help you as you age. Step one: let's make Mamie Young a webapp with a database, so that home repair people can sign up, creating a list that people in need can refer to.","git_branch":"master","last_pushed_within":"over_a_year","link_url":"https://codepen.io/MiriamP/pen/pQoVEQ","name":"mamie_young-s_finding_home_repair_help_for_philadelphia_seniors","organization_name":"Code for Philly","status":"Bootstrapping","topics":["help for homes","repair people","Seniors"]},"relationships":{"organization":{"data":{"type":"organization","id":"Code for Philly"},"links":{"related":"/organizations/Code for Philly.json"}}}}}
