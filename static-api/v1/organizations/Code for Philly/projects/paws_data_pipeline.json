Since inception over 10 years ago, PAWS has rescued and placed 27,000+ animals in adoptive and foster homes, and has worked to prevent pet homelessness by providing 86,000+ low-cost spay/neuter services and affordable vet care to 227,000+ clinic patients. Just in 2018, 3,584 animals were rescued and 36,871 clinic patients were served. PAWS is funded 100% through donations, with 91 cents of every dollar collected going directly to the animals. Therefore, PAWS' rescue work (including 3 shelters and all rescue and animal care programs), administration and development efforts are coordinated by only about 70 staff members complemented by over 1500 volunteers.","git_branch":"master","last_pushed_within":"week","name":"paws_data_pipeline","organization_name":"Code for Philly","status":"Prototyping","topics":["Animal Shelters/Pet Adoption","data management"]},"relationships":{"organization":{"data":{"type":"organization","id":"Code for Philly"},"links":{"related":"/organizations/Code for Philly.json"}}}}}
