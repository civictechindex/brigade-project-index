Can be used on its own with built in screen or can have data routed to it to extend the functionality of other open source projects. We've nicknamed it HiJump because the signal between devices involves a combo of hi/low transmissions and because once a device receives a payload, the devices around it are checked to see if they have yet received that specific payload. If not, it then jumps to them. The goal is for this device to be small enough to comfortably fit onto a keychain, to contain a low-res character based display, and text input.","link_url":"http://jamorat.github.io/hijump","name":"mesh_networking_hardware","organization_name":"Code for Philly","status":"Hibernating","topics":["Education","Mesh","science"]},"relationships":{"organization":{"data":{"type":"organization","id":"Code for Philly"},"links":{"related":"/organizations/Code for Philly.json"}}}}}
