They would like to visually display the data in tables, graphs, and ultimately a \"heat map\" to show how women have been represented in PA from 2000-2014.  Click the developer's link to go to the GitHub page.  We are working in Python and potentially JavaScript down the line to display this data in a palatable manner for end users.","git_branch":"master","last_pushed_within":"over_a_year","name":"female_political_representation_in_pa","organization_name":"Code for Philly","status":"Bootstrapping","topics":["Equality","Politics","Women's Rights"]},"relationships":{"organization":{"data":{"type":"organization","id":"Code for Philly"},"links":{"related":"/organizations/Code for Philly.json"}}}}}
